Avoid Conflicts {Syncing your fork}
An easy way to avoid conflicts is to add an 'upstream' for your git repo, as other PR's may be merged while you're working on your branch/fork.

git remote add upstream https://github.com/fineanmol/Hacktoberfest2022
You can verify that the new remote has been added by typing

git remote -v
To pull any new changes from your parent repo simply run

git merge upstream/master
This will give you any eventual conflicts and allow you to easily solve them in your repo. It's a good idea to use it frequently in between your own commits to make sure that your repo is up to date with its parent.
